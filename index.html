                In 1961, shortly before their rise to fame, the Beatles played a local gig at the Cavern Club in
                Liverpool. Now, rare photos of the group—including original drummer Pete Best—from that performance
                have
                been discovered. The band would release its first single, “Love Me Do,” a year later.
              </p>

              <p>

                Paul Wane, managing director at Tracks, a music memorabilia company based in the United Kingdom that
                owns
                the photos, tells CNN’s Jack Guy that the photos were taken by a fan who followed the nascent pop band
                in
                the early 1960s, before they had officially released any music.

                <p>The photos were taken by a Liverpool-based fan. Courtesy of Tracks Ltd.</p>
              </div>

              <p>“Not many people had cameras back then,” says Wane. “That’s why there are so few shots of the Beatles
                in
                the Cavern. There’s very, very, very few.”
                All of the Beatles were born in Liverpool, and the city is where the band formed. Lennon and McCartney
                first performed there together in 1957.
              </p>
              <p>

                The newly discovered photos feature John Lennon, 20, and Paul McCartney, 19, singing and playing
                guitar;
                George Harrison, 18, also plays guitar, while Best, 19, plays drums behind them. Drummer Ringo Starr
                wouldn’t join the band until 1962, a little over a year later, completing the “Fab Four.”</p>
